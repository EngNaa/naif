# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Banks, merchants, and credit card processor companies lose billions of dollars every year in credit
card fraud. Credit card data can be stolen by criminals using a variety of methods. Bluetoothenabled
data skimming devices can be placed on the card reader on the pump that dispenses your
petrol. The data might be stolen in a mass breach by hackers of a large retailer, as was the case
with Target and Home Depot in recent years. Sometimes the criminal is simply the clerk at the
checkout line at the grocery or in a restaurant, where the victim’s card is swiped through a small
device or surreptitiously jotted down. For this in our project, we will use machine learning to
credit card fraud Detection to reduce the loss of billions of dollars every year in credit card fraud.
## Data Description:
In my project, I will use a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants. \\

## Algorithms
I used Classification algorithms of supervised learning. There are many different classification models in machine learning: 
> *  Logistic Regression.
> *  K-Nearest Neighbor.
> *  Random Forest Classification.
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 1.3.4
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.21.2
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 3.4.3
> *  [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.24.2
> ## Results:
After applying the different classification models, I got the accuracies with different models below:
> *  1. Logistic Regression 0.95%
> *  2. Nearest Neighbors 0.96%
> *  3. Random Forest Classification 0.99%
### Random Forest Classification gave the best results for this dataset
